Here’s a breakdown of how each of these components can be implemented in the MVP:

### Data Points for MVP:

1. **Transcription**:

   - **Description**: Convert uploaded audio files into text to provide a readable and searchable version of the conversation.
   - **Implementation**: Use a transcription service like AWS Transcribe, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, or any other reliable transcription API.

2. **User Query**:

   - **Description**: Identify and extract the customer’s questions or issues from the conversation transcript.
   - **Implementation**: Use NLP techniques to detect common question phrases or segments where the customer describes their problem.

3. **Agent Answer**:

   - **Description**: Extract the agent's response to the user's query, focusing on the resolution provided.
   - **Implementation**: Use NLP models to distinguish between the customer and agent parts and summarize the agent’s response.

4. **Frequently Mentioned Keywords**:

   - **Description**: Highlight key topics or issues discussed frequently during the conversation.
   - **Implementation**: Use keyword extraction algorithms (such as TF-IDF or RAKE) to identify the most frequently mentioned words or phrases.

5. **Adherence to SOP: Score**:

   - **Description**: Provide a score indicating how closely the conversation adhered to the company's Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).
   - **Implementation**: Define key SOP steps and use text-matching or rule-based systems to check for their presence in the transcript. Assign weights to each step to calculate the adherence score.

6. **Missed SOP Steps**:

   - **Description**: List any SOP steps that were not followed or were missing from the conversation.
   - **Implementation**: Compare the conversation transcript with a checklist of SOP steps and identify the missing ones.

7. **Completed SOP Steps**:

   - **Description**: List the SOP steps that were successfully followed during the conversation.
   - **Implementation**: Similar to the "Missed SOP Steps," but list the steps that match the SOP criteria.

8. **Overall Sentiment**:

   - **Description**: Determine the overall sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) of the conversation.
   - **Implementation**: Use sentiment analysis models (e.g., VADER, BERT-based models) to analyze the transcript and provide an overall sentiment score.

9. **Talk-to-Listen Ratio**:
   - **Description**: Calculate the ratio of the time the agent spent talking versus the time the customer spent talking.
   - **Implementation**: Use speaker diarization to distinguish between speakers and calculate the total speaking time for the agent and the customer.

### Example MVP User Interface Design:

- **Conversation Dashboard**: Display a list of all uploaded conversations with columns for Agent Name, User Query, Adherence to SOP Score, Overall Sentiment, and Frequently Mentioned Keywords.
- **Detailed Conversation View**:
  - **Transcription**: Full text transcript with color-coded segments for user queries and agent answers.
  - **Adherence to SOP**: Score displayed prominently, with expandable sections showing completed and missed SOP steps.
  - **Keywords**: Tag cloud or list of frequently mentioned keywords.
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Sentiment score and a visual indicator (e.g., smiley face or color-coded bar).
  - **Talk-to-Listen Ratio**: Pie chart or bar graph representing the ratio.
